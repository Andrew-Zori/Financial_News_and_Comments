# A week of US inflation, China RRR cut & French Election

## US Soaring Inflation & Subsequent Hawkish Fed
8.5% inflation marks the highest inflation in US since 1981. Surging price in food & energy, together with import cost are the main reasons for this
continued trend.  

As a result, we are witnessing a [more Hawkish Fed](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/myJs_VRglpDccqe0hzSqTg):
> - William: "50 bps rate hike is reasonable" ('ps: increase the chance of 50 bps rate hike in May 4th FOMC & 3 * 50 bps rate hikes in 2022)  
> - Mester: ["Fed aims to bring elevated inflation under control given pandemic-era low UE data"](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fed-aims-bring-elevated-inflation-under-control-mester-2022-04-14/) ('ps: Fed can be less sensitive to potential future negative labor market data')  
> - Harker: "Expected incoming QT very soon."  
  
Given such comments, the market reverse its previous "dial back" and pushed the 2-year UST yield from 2.35% to 2.5% from Apr 13th to Apr 18th.

It's also worth noting that the USDJPY has been steadily increasing from 113 to 126 in the past four month, due to the discrepancy of a Hawkish Fed and Dovish BOJ.
Great to know another way to invest in more Hawkish Fed besides Nasdaq.  
  
But there are followers for Fed, too. BOE is closely following Fed hikes and reserves 25 bps interest rate spread for Fed, while EOB is expected to have 2 rate hikes in 2022, too.

### A quick note for Ukraine & Russian Conflict
The war showed no sign to subside:
- Apr 13: [Putin claimed the negotiation talk is at "dead end"](https://thehill.com/policy/international/3265928-putin-says-talks-with-ukraine-are-at-dead-end/)
- Apr 14: US provided $800 Million Millitary support for Ukraine
It's worth noting that the war can further deteriorate the global energy supply.

## China COVID Challenge & Supportive Monetary Policy
COVID evolvement:  
- Steady 20k daily new cases in Shanghai  
- Asserted "Society-level zero" accomplishment in Jilin city & Changchun city, but showed no sign of ease for lockdown  
- Elevated sensitivity towards new case: Wuhu city imposed a lockdown after reporting 1 new case of Omicron

China Economy:
A great looback with worrisome outlook due to lockdown risk:
- Mar: PMI: 
  - 49.5 (NSB) & 48.1 (Caixin) in Manufacturing
  - 45.7 (NSB) & 42 (Caixin) in Service
- Apr 18: 4.8% quarterly national GDP increase
- EV industry: Weilai EV warns of production shutdown if supply chain bottleneck continues in Shanghai, while Tesla plans to partly resume production (Caixin).

Policy:
- Favorable policy on LGSB (To be added by Warren)
- Apr 16: Grant of Game licence
- Apr 18: [25 bps RRR cut](https://finance.caixin.com/2022-04-18/101871740.html)

Comments:
Can we expect more supportive monetary policy given a combination of "Firm Zero-Covid policy + Commitment to Economy growth" in China?
