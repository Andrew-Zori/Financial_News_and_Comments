# A week of US inflation, China RRR cut & French Election

## US Soaring Inflation & Subsequent Hawkish Fed
8.5% inflation marks the highest inflation in US since 1981. Surging price in food & energy, together with import cost are the main reasons for this
continued trend.  

As a result, we are witnessing a [more Hawkish Fed](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/myJs_VRglpDccqe0hzSqTg):
> William: "50 bps rate hike is reasonable" ('ps: increase the chance of 50 bps rate hike in May 4th FOMC & 3 * 50 bps rate hikes in 2022)  
> Mester: ["Fed aims to bring elevated inflation under control given pandemic-era low UE data"](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fed-aims-bring-elevated-inflation-under-control-mester-2022-04-14/) ('ps: Fed can be less sensitive to potential future negative labor market data')  
> Harker: "Expected incoming QT very soon."  

Given such comments, the market reverse its previous "dial back" and pushed the 2-year UST yield from 2.35% to 2.5% from Apr 13th to Apr 18th.

It's also worth noting that the USDJPY has been steadily increasing from 113 to 126 in the past four month, due to the discrepancy of a Hawkish Fed and Dovish BOJ.
Great to know another way to invest in more Hawkish Fed besides Nasdaq.
